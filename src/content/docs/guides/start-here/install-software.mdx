import { Steps, Code, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

export const installHomebrewCode = `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`;
export const codeTitle = 'Terminal command';

So, you wanna get into the good stuff, eh? Your own local demo environment you control? Reusable demo data that makes repeatable and sharable demos possible?

**Dope.** I'm here for it, and I'm here for you.

Before we go deep, there're a few general purpose programs and tools you're gonna need to install onto your Mac that will prove _super_ helpful to you.

- **Mac OS Package Manager** - <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew</a>

## Visual Studio Code

VS Code is a popular code editor for web developers, built by Microsoft. 

_Why use a code editor_, you ask? I'll tell you why!

As you dig deeper into concepts like data packs and the VM Builder, you'll actually be working with a lot of, well, code. Data packs are collections of `JSON` and `CSV` files, and the VM Builder uses `JSON` too.  Using VS Code to create and edit these files is way easier than any other method.

VS Code also comes with other stuff too, like:

- A **file browser** for easily opening and working with files in a folder
- An **integrated terminal** for working with command-line interfaces (CLI's) which is _waaaay_ better than the native Mac `Terminal`. (Like, **way** better)

## Homebrew

Homebrew is an application manager for Mac. Whereas many popular developers publish their Mac applications to Apple's App Store, Homebrew makes it possible for developers to publish their applications to the world _without_ depending on the App Store (which charges them money to publish their apps). Users who want these applications can download and install them using Mac's `Terminal` application. In our case, we can actually install all of the other applications we need using Homebrew!

### Install via Terminal
<Steps>

1. Hover over the following command and copy it using the icon on the right

</Steps>

<Code code={installHomebrewCode} lang="bash" title={codeTitle} />

<Steps>

2. Open your Mac's `Terminal` application.  You can either open your `Applications` from a `Finder` window, or you can search for `Terminal` using your Mac's Spotlight feature.  Press `CMD+Space` to access Spotlight and type in what you want.

3. In the `Terminal` window, paste in the command above.

4. Press `Enter`.

5. Wait for the installation to complete, then close the `Terminal`.

</Steps>

<Aside type='tip'>
Just so you know, you don't _have_ to be a nerd like Steve and use the terminal to install Homebrew. You can actually install it using a more traditional point-and-click approach.

### Install via Mouse
<Steps>

1. Navigate to [Homebrew's latest GitHub release](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/releases/latest)

2. Scroll to the bottom of the page

3. Under the **Assets** heading, find the .pkg link (e.g. **Homebrew-4.2.17.pkg**) and click to download

4. Double click to open and follow the installer prompts to complete the installation
