## What Are Data Packs?

**Data Packs** are collections of **data files** (`.json` and/or `.csv`) and **media files** which can be used to create sample data for Adobe Commerce.

Data Packs depend on a custom module called the **Data Installer**.  This custom module, designed by Jeff Britts, extends the native import/export capabilities of Adobe Commerce beyond the natively-supported data types so that almost any piece of data in Adobe Commerce can be imported as a data file.

Once the data and media files are collected and zipped, the data pack `.zip` file can then be imported into an Adobe Commerce installation in order to create demo use cases.

## Data Pack Structure

A data pack can have as many or as few files in it as you need it to.  Here's a diagram showing the typical file structure a data pack uses, and the complete list of files it can contain:

Since data packs are made up largely of `.json` and/or `.csv` files, let's dive into a brief primer on what JSON is and how it works.
