The `stores.json` file adds new websites, stores, and/or store views to an installation of Adobe Commerce. Let's add a new website, store, and store view to our data pack.

<Steps>

1. Create a `stores.json` file in your pack's `data` directory.

</Steps>

<FileTree>

    - bodea/
      - data/
        - settings.json
        - **stores.json**
      - media/

</FileTree>

<Steps>

2. Add the following to the `stores.json` file and save.

</Steps>

<Code code={storesJsonCode} lang="json" title="stores.json" />

Within its opening object, this `stores.json` file has a `data` object which contains a `storeConfig` object which contains a collection of settings for websites, stores, and store views as key-value pairs.

<Aside type='note'>
The `stores.json` format is great for creating a single site, store, and store view. You can use a `csv` file when you want to create multiple sites, stores, and views.
</Aside>

## Result

When this `stores.json` file is processed, it will do the following things:

### Create A New Website

<Steps>

1. Create a new website named **Bodea US** with a website code `bodea_us`

</Steps>

### Create A New Store

<Steps>

2. Create a new root category with an `id` `2` named **Bodea Catalog**

3. Create a new store in the new **Bodea US** website with a store code `bodea_us_store` which uses the new **Bodea Catalog** root category

4. Make the new **Bodea US Store** the default store in the **Bodea US Website**

</Steps>

### Create A New Store View

<Steps>

5. Create a new store view in the **Bodea US Store** with a store view code `bodea_us_en` named **US English**

6. Set the new **US English** store view as the default view in the **Bodea US Store** store

7. Set the store view sort order to `1`

8. Set the store view's theme to `Magento/luma`

9. Use the `Magento/luma` theme as a fallback in case there is no value supplied for `theme`.  (Won't apply in this case)
